## Help Henri the Hermit Hedge the Hostile Henchmen

You play as Henri the Hermit crab (a Rust-acean), and must defend your shell from unfriendly sea creatures. While a Hermit Crab's shell is a house, it does not offer sufficient storage for all of your crustacean needs.

## Control your shell space

Click on the arrow-shaped gizmos to move and rotate your collected items to help you fit them in your shell.
This can also be controlled with the following keys: **W/A/S/D** (move item), **Q/E/R/F** (rotate item), **Arrow Keys** (rotate grid).

## A Hermit is reclusive
Henri lives alone and fights alone, you will meet ill-natured sea creatures that desire nothing more than break your shell.

You can cycle to the next weapon by clicking on it on the top left corner, or by pressing **Tab**. Make sure to
hold down the **left mouse button** for weapons that can auto-attack.
